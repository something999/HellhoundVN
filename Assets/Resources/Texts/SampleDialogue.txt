SCENE - ZUCKERBORK

Acacia: "Is this…an office…?" [Confused]
Zuckerbork: "Ah, so my cawooculations were correct then. You arrived here exactly at the time I predicted." [Neutral]
"Shame you killed my packmate though. She wasn't the brightest of the litter but she still had her charms I suppose..." [Neutral]

Acacia: "W-wait! I didn't kill anyone!" [Surprise]
"I just gave her a fortune is all! I'd never do something like that..." [Surprise]
 
Zuckerbork:"Fortune...? Hahahah, perpawsterous!" [Disgust]
"Childish magic tricks can't compete with reality, not even here in Hell." [Disgust]
"Why don't I eat you right now and we can both get this over with?" [Neutral]
"I have to release and update for Snoutbook in an hour and I would rather it not be late due to some crystal ball mumbo jumbo." [Neutral]

Acacia: 'Shit, he doesn't seem as carefree as the last one.' [Fear]
'If I don't figure something out fast I'm dog food.' [Fear]
"H-hold on a sec!" [Fear]
