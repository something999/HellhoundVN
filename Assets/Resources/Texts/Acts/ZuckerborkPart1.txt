SCENE - DARK
Acacia: 'Ugh...my head…'[Disgust]
'What even happened?'[Disgust]
'This is the last time I go to an astrology convention. Swear on it!'
'All of them are way too wild for me...'
'Hey, wait a minute.'
'Why do I feel so warm?'

SCENE - OFFICE
Acacia:"Woah, woah, woah!"
"What is this?! Where am I?!"[Surprised]
"Is this an office? What even happened last night?"[Confused]

???: “Ah, it appears you are our newest arrival."[Neutral]
"Ms.Acacia, it’s a pleasure to make you acquaintance."[Neutral]
Zuckerbork: "I am Zuckerbork, resident hellhound of, you guessed it, Hell."[Neutral] 
 
Acacia: "Ah, well, hello Mr.Zuckerbork, sir!" [Happy]
"Quick question -- WHAT THE FUCK?"[Fear]
"I can't be--? Unless I’m--? How are you--?"[Confused]
"Am I….dead....?"[Fear]

Zuckerbork: "In simple terms yes..."
"But in complicated terms, no."[Neutral]
"I could explain it to you, but it’s a lot of paperwork."[Neutral]
"And I don’t have the time nor the patience to go through it all."[Disgust]
"At any rate, let's proceed to the execution procedures."[Neutral]

Acacia: "Wait a minute…'[Confused]
"<b>EXECUTION???</b>"[Fear]

Zuckerbork: "Ah, yes."
"While the majority of the humans here are destined to do hard labor for the rest of their eternal existence, a select few are chosen to act as sustenance for us hounds and the other creatures of Hell."[Neutral]
"What a lucky soul you are."
"You get a quick, most painless end to your afterlife."[Happy]
"You should be happy."
"<b>Really happy.</b>"[Happy]

Acacia: 'Oh my god. He’s actually going to eat me…'
'I need to do something -- and quick!'
"W-wait a second!"
"What if I, uh, gave you something in exchange for not eating me?"

 Zuckerbork: "...Listen here Ms.Acacia."[Neutral]
"I am the richest hound in the entire underworld and a top ranking official at that."[Angry]
"What do you have that I could ever possibly want?"[Angry]

Acacia: "I could...um...uh..."
'Come on, think!'
"...read your fortune?"
'....I’m dead.'

Zuckerbork:"Fortune...?"[Confused]
"Hahahah, perpawsterous!" [Disgust]
"Childish magic tricks can't compete with reality, not even here in Hell." [Disgust]
"Why don't I eat you right now and we can both get this over with?" [Neutral]
"I have to release and update for Snoutbook in an hour and I would rather it not be late due to some crystal ball mumbo jumbo." [Neutral]

Acacia: 'Shit, he’s not buying it!'
'If I don't figure something out fast, I'm dog food.' 
"H-hold on a sec!" 

Zuckerbork: "Didn’t you just hear me? I would rather not be late so pipe down and-" [Angry]

Acacia: "I’ll read your fortune!"
"You talk big, but for a facts and logic guy you don’t seem to be able to back it up."
"How about I prove it to you?"

Zuckerbork: "....." [Neutral]
"...Heheh" [Neutral]
"Hahahaha." [Happy]
"Aahahahahahahahahahahahah!" [Happy]
"Fine, you’ve intrigued me runt" [Happy]
"If you can provide satisfactory fortune, you get to leave." [Neutral]
"If not, I’m going to have to take a lunch break." [Disgust]

Acacia: 'Oh god….'

Zuckerbork: "Alright, let’s get this dogwash over with."[Neutral]
"I’m a very busy pooch as you know." [Neutral]

Acacia: 'He doesn’t seem like he’ll be easily convinced…'
'He’s a business dog right? Maybe instead of love his fortune could be prosperity?'
'Yeah yeah, good plan Acacia!'
"Alright let’s do this!"
