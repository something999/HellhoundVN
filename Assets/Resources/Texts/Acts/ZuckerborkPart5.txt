Zuckerbork: "Well, I must say, this went very different from how I expected."[Happy]
"Thank you for enlightening me on the ways of fortune telling."[Happy]
"From now on, I’ll try not to be so much of a bone in the mud about the unknown."[Happy]

Acacia: "I’m glad I was able to help out!"
"...Does this by chance mean I won’t be eaten?"

Zuckerbork: "Hahahaha! You’re shaking like a newborn pup!"[Laughing]
"No, you will not be eaten. I’d say it’s fair trade for helping me with my career."[Happy]
"Though this does mean you’ll have to get past my co-worker."[Neutral]

Acacia: "Wait there’s more of you?!?!"
"Ugh I don’t know if I can handle that…"

Zuckerbork: “Well it’s not like you have much a choice."[Neutral]
"You’ve proven yourself to be quite likable so I will offer you this advice."[Neutral]
"She has recently broken up with her boyfriend and is quite upset about it."
"Perhaps you could offer her some advice?"[Confused]

Acacia:"Well, at least it’s something. Thanks."

 Zuckerbork:"Don’t mention it."[Neutral]
"Now if you’ll excuse me, I have to start looking for career goals."[Neutral]
"Run along now. If you’re lucky you might be the first human to make it out of hell!"[Happy]

Acacia: "I’ll try my best, sir."
