SCENE - OFFICE
Acacia: “Is this…an office…?” [Confused]

Zuckerbork: "Ah, so my cawooculations were correct then. You arrived here exactly at the time I predicted." [Neutral]
"Shame you killed my packmate though. She wasn't the brightest of the litter but she still had her charms I suppose..." [Neutral]

Acacia: "W-wait! I didn't kill anyone!" [Surprise]
"I just gave her a fortune is all! I'd never do something like that..." [Surprise]
 
Zuckerbork:"Fortune...? Hahahah, perpawsterous!" [Disgust]
"Childish magic tricks can't compete with reality, not even here in Hell." [Disgust]
"Why don't I eat you right now and we can both get this over with?" [Neutral]
"I have to release and update for Snoutbook in an hour and I would rather it not be late due to some crystal ball mumbo jumbo." [Neutral]

Acacia: 'Shit, he doesn't seem as carefree as the last one.' [Fear]
'If I don't figure something out fast I'm dog food.' [Fear]
"H-hold on a sec!" [Fear]

Zuckerbork: “Didn’t you just hear me? I would rather not be late so pipe down and-” [Angry]

Acacia: “I’ll read your fortune!” [Angry]
“You talk big but for a facts and logic guy you don’t seem to be able to back it up” [Angry]
“How about I prove it to you?” [Happy]

Zuckerbork:”.....” [Neutral]
“...Heheh” [Neutral]
“Hahahaha.” [Happy]
“Aahahahahahahahahahahahah!” [Happy]
“Fine, you’ve intrigued me runt” [Happy]
“If you can provide satisfactory fortune, you get to leave.” [Neutral]
“If not…..I’m going to have to take a lunch break.”[Disgust]

Acacia: ‘Oh god….’ [Fear]

Zuckerbork: “Alright let’s get this dogwash over with.”[Neutral]
“I’m a very busy pooch as you know.” [Neutral]

Acacia: ‘He doesn’t seem like he’ll be easily convinced…’ [Fear]
‘He’s a business dog right? Maybe instead of love his fortune could be prosperity?’ [Confused]
‘Yeah yeah, good plan Acacia!’ [Happy]
“Alright let’s do this!” [Happy]

Acacia: ‘Ok first up in the past card.’
‘Let’s see...he couldn’t have always been rich right?’
‘Maybe I should start there.’
