Acacia: "Hermit, in the upright position. This card represents your past."
"This is telling me you were alone as a pup." 
"Through your seclusion you were able to properly focus on your career, and guide yourself to where you are now."
"Is that accurate?"

Zuckerbork: "While it does have some truth to it, I can’t say your reading is 100% accurate." [Neutral]
"Even though I was alone, It’s not so much seclusion that led me down this path..."[Neutral]
"You seem to be using broad strokes here. I suggest you become a bit more specific if you know what’s good for you…"[Irritated] 

Acacia: "Um, I understand!"
'Shit I messed up! I need to think carefully about the meaning of these cards…'
