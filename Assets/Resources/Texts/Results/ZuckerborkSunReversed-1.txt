Acacia: "The Sun, reversed. This represents the present." 
"Being tossed away like that must’ve really hurt."
"I imagine your complicated childhood is really weighing on you and enforced by your current work." 
 "But you shouldn’t let it dictate your life!"

Zuckerbork: "What are you going on about?"[Confused]
"I’m not upset about my childhood."[Neutral] 
"That’s all behind me now. I’ve shown everyone who doubted me that I’m not worthless."[Happy]
"I have nothing left to gain from that part of my life."[Sadness]

Acacia: "Ah, I see."
‘Shit I messed up! I need to think carefully about the meaning of these cards…’
