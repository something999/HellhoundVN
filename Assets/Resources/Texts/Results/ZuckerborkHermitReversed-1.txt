Acacia: "The Hermit, reversed. This represents the present."[Neutral]
"What this is telling me is that you’re not feeling 100% with your current work."[Neutral]
"Am I right?"[Neutral]

Zuckerbork: "...Go on."[Neutral]

Acacia: "Well, the Hermit reversed is about feeling lost and alone."[Neutral]
"From what I can infer, you’ve been alone the majority of your life."[Sadness]
"To be thrown out because you’re seen as nothing must’ve really took a toll on your self worth."[Sadness]
"Tell me Mr.Zuckerbork, why did you create Snoutbook?"[Confused]

Zuckerbork: "To prove them all wrong of course!"[Neutral]
"Everyone I’ve ever met told me my life wouldn’t amount to anything."[Neutral]
"They said I’d be lucky if I ended up as cattle for the demons."[Anger]
"So I learned to code and became a business dog."[Anger]
"Now I'm the richest hound in hell!"[Happy]

Acacia: "That’s really great, and I’m happy for you."[Happy]
"But did you ever stop to consider that maybe you’re not very fulfilled with your success?"[Neutral]

Zuckerbork: "Hmm? How so?" [Confused]

Acacia: "Well, you did all this to prove everyone wrong, and that’s great." [Neutral]
"But what about you? Are you working for yourself, or just to make a point?"[Neutral]
"I know the distinction doesn’t look like it matters, but it’s important to do what you want to do."[Sadness]
"That’s what this card is telling you. To sit down and adjust your career to what you want!"[Happy] 

Zuckerbork: "I suppose you have a point."[Neutral]
"I’ve been thinking lately... that maybe running and business and coding...isn’t my true calling."[Sadness]
"These cards have proven themselves at least somewhat useful. So if I may ask…"[Neutral]
"What should I do to remedy this?"[Confused]
