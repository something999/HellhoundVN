Acacia: "The Hermit, reversed. This represents the present."
"What this is telling me is that you’re not feeling 100% with your current work."
"Am I right?"

Zuckerbork: "...Go on."[Neutral]

Acacia: "Well, the Hermit reversed is about feeling lost and alone."
"From what I can infer, you’ve been alone the majority of your life."
"To be thrown out because you’re seen as nothing must’ve really took a toll on your self worth."
"Tell me Mr.Zuckerbork, why did you create Snoutbook?"

Zuckerbork: "To prove them all wrong of course!"[Irritated]
"Everyone I’ve ever met told me my life wouldn’t amount to anything."[Anger]
"They said I’d be lucky if I ended up as cattle for the demons."[Anger]
"So I learned to code and became a business dog."[Irritated]
"Now I'm the richest hound in hell!"[Happy]

Acacia: "That’s really great, and I’m happy for you."
"But did you ever stop to consider that maybe you’re not very fulfilled with your success?"

Zuckerbork: "Hmm? How so?" [Confused]

Acacia: "Well, you did all this to prove everyone wrong, and that’s great." 
"But what about you? Are you working for yourself, or just to make a point?"
"I know the distinction doesn’t look like it matters, but it’s important to do what you want to do."
"That’s what this card is telling you. To sit down and adjust your career to what you want!"

Zuckerbork: "I suppose you have a point."[Confused]
"I’ve been thinking lately... that maybe running and business and coding...isn’t my true calling."[Sadness]
"These cards have proven themselves at least somewhat useful. So if I may ask..."[Sadness]
"What should I do to remedy this?"[Neutral]
