Acacia: "The Devil, in the upright position. This card represents your past."
"Tell me Mr.Zuckerbork, did you have a lot growing up?" 

Zuckerbork: "What do you mean?" [Confused]

Acacia: "Well the Devil card represents attachment to material things."
"Since this is your past card, I’m assuming money played some kind of factor in your childhood."

Zuckerbork: "......" [Neutral]
"I was the runt of my litter…" [Sadness]
"They deemed me useless and thus I was thrown away with the others like me." [Sadness]
"We were barely given so much as a glance. Let alone these “material things” you keep yapping about." [Irritated]
"...It’s not like it matters much anymore."[Irritated]
"Now I’m part of the top dog security here in Hell, and I’m rich enough to buy every hound in hell a new squeaker twice." [Angry]
"I showed them…" [Irritated]

Acacia: 'Woah...I thought rich people struggling was just a thing that happened in movies…' 
'I guess capitalism works differently in Hell.' 
"It must’ve been hard for you...I’m so sorry." 
"This card seems to represent your struggle with having nothing." [Neutral]
"From that you had work hard and climb your way to the top, leading us to the now."
"Am I right?" 

Zuckerbork: "Yes, that is correct…" [Neutral]
"Shall we move on? I’d rather not dwell on the past too much…" [Sadness]

Acacia: "Of course..."
