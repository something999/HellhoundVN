"I thought this would be a quick way to shut you up, but it appears that I was wrong."
"Thank you for enlightening me on the ways of fortune-telling." [Happy]
"From now on, I'll try to not be so dimissive about the divinatory arts."

Acacia: "I'm glad I was able to help you out!"

"Perhaps you can offer her some relationship advice?" [Confused]

"Thanks."

Zuckerbork: "Don't mention it." [Happy]
"Now if you'll excuse me, I have to start looking for career goals."
"If you're lucky, you might be the first human to make it out of hell!" [Laughing]

Acacia: "I'll try my best..."
