Acacia: "Woah, woah, woah! What is this?! Where am I?!"
"Is this an office? What even happened last night?"

???: "Ah, it appears you are our newest arrival." [Confused]
"Ms. Acacia Pantazis, it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance." [Neutral]
"I am Zuckerbork, resident hellhound of -- obviously -- <b>Hell</b>." [Happy]
[Neutral]

Acacia: "Ah, well, hello Mr. Zuckerbork -- sir!"
"Quick question -- WHAT THE FUCK?"
"I can't be here unless I'm --? How are you --?"
"Shit. Am I...dead?"

Zuckerbork: "In simple terms, yes, you are dead."
"In complicated terms, your mental faculties are still functioning, and thus, by some standards, you are not dead."
"I could explain the specifics of your situation, but it is a lot of paperwork."
"And I do not have the time or patience to retrieve such trivial information when I could reveal your fate now."
"So, Ms. Pantazis, let us discuss your execution."
"Would you like your body to be braised, roasted, or fried?" [Confused]

Acacia: "First, I prefer Acacia and second -- EXECUTION?!"

Zuckerbork: "Indeed Ms. Acacia, you are to be executed." [Neutral]
"You see, while the majority of humans here are destined to hard labor for eternity, a select few are chosen to act as sustenance for us hounds and the other creatures of Hell."
"What a lucky soul you are to receive such a quick, painless end to your afterlife -- after the cutting of course."
"You should be happy."
"<b>Really happy</b>." [Happy]

Acacia: "(Oh, fuck, he's actually going to eat me.)"
"(I need to do something quick!)"
"W-wait a second, Mr. Zuckerbork!"
"What if instead of eating me, I gave you something equally enticing? "

Zuckerbork: "..." [Disgust]
"Ms. Acacia, I fear that you do not understand who you are attempting to barter with."
"I am the richest hound in the entire underworld and a top-ranking official at that." [Angry]
"What could you have that I could every possibly want?"

Acacia: "I could, um, uh..."
"(Come on, Acacia, think of something you can offer!)"
"...read your fortune?"
"(I'm dead.)"

Zuckerbork: "Read my fortune?" [Confused]
"Hahaha, perpawsterous!" [Laughing]
"Childish magic tricks cannot complete with reality, not even here in Hell." [Happy]
"Why should I not eat you now and allow us to both get this over with?" [Disgust]
"I have to release an update for Snoutbook in an hour."
"And I would rather not be late due to some divinatory nonsense."

Acacia: "(Shit, he's not buying it!)"
"(If I don't figure something out fast, I'm dog food!)"
"H-hold on a sec!"

Zuckerbork: "Did you not hear me earlier?" [Angry]
"I would rather not delay this update again, so pipe down and --"

Acacia: "I'm reading your fortune!"
"You talk big, but for a facts and logic guy, you don't have anything you can use to back up your statement."
"Anyone can draw a tarot card, but only fortune-tellers can interpret them."
"Let me present the cards, and you can judge the accuracy of my statements."
"If my reading is completely off, you can eat me."
"But you won't be able to know what the cards say unless you listen to me."

Zuckerbork: "..." [Disgust]
"...heheheh." [Neutral]
"Hahahaha." [Happy]
"<b>Ahahahahahahahahahahahah!</b>" [Laughing]
"Fine, you intrigued me runt." [Neutral]
"If you can provide a satisfactory fortune, you get to leave." [Neutral]
"But if not, I am going to have a little lunch break." [Happy]
[Neutral]
Acacia: "(Oh, fuck, he doesn't seem like he'll be easily convinced.)"
"(Relax, Acacia, you've done readings before!)"
"(Just draw three cards for the past, present, and future.)"
"(Don't present the same card twice, and try to choose a card that relates to the conversation.)"

"(OK, first card is for the past.)"
"(This guy is a business hound, and he said he had a lot of money.)"
"(But he couldn't have always been rich, right?)"
"(Everyone starts from somewhere, so maybe I should start by asking about his background.)"
"(Yeah, yeah, background is a good start -- you can do this, Acacia!)"
"(Let's show this hound the power of the tarot cards!"
