<<Darkness>>
Acacia: "(Ugh, my head...what even happened?)"
"(Last time I go to an astrology convention -- I swear!)"
"(Telling fortunes was fun, but those gatherings are too wild for me.)"
"(Now I'm lost. Without my coat. And my cell phone. Shit.)"
"(If only my tarot cards could provide literal directions.)"
"(But wherever I am, it's strangely...warm?)"
