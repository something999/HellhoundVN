Acacia: "(Alright, Acacia, past is done!)"
"(Giving tarot card reads to hungry hounds isn't too hard.)"
"(Now to do the present -- hang on.)"
{{Sun | Hermit}}
"(Shit, I can't work off of these!)"
"(Happiness and aimlessness -- these cards' meanings are unrelated to what's going on!)"
"(I'm screwed!)"

Zuckerbork: "Is something wrong, Ms. Acacia?" [Confused]
"You seem to be a bit pale." [Neutral]
"Perhaps you messed up your little magic trick?" [Happy]

Acacia: "N-no, it's not that!"
"It's just that these cards have very interesting meanings!"
"It'll just take me a bit to properly interpret them."
"I wanna give you an accurate reading, ya know?"
"(Smooth, Acacia, smooth.)"

Zuckerbork: "..." [Neutral]
"Given the accuracy of your past interpretation, I suppose I can wait a bit longer."
"Take your time."

Acacia: "(Shoot, if I don't think of something, I'm done for!)"
"(What can I do with these cards again? Hold them, shuffle them, flip them -- wait a sec!)"
"(I've been using my cards in the upright position!)"
"(In tarot, reversed cards represent the opposite of their upright meanings.)"
"(I might be able to present a meaning relevant to the current situation if I reverse the Sun or Hermit.)"
"(OK, let's deal with the present!)"
