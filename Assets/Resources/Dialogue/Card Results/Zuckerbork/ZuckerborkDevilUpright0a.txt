Acacia: "The Devil, in the upright position."
"This card represents your past."
"Tell me, Mr. Zuckerbork -- did you have a lot growing up?"
 
Zuckerbork: 'Define "a lot."' [Confused]
 
Acacia: "Well, the Devil card represents attachment to material goods."
"Since this is your past card, I'm assuming money played some kind of factor in your childhood?"
 
Zuckerbork: "...I will only say this once." [Disgust]
"I was the runt of my litter." [Neutral]
"My parents deemed me useless and abandoned me at the kennels with only the clothes on my back."
"Thus, I was thrown away with others like me." [Sadness]
'We were barely given so much as a glance, let alone these "material things" you keep yapping about!' [Disgust]
"Not like it matters anymore."
"Now <b>I</b> am part of the top hound security here in Hell, and <b>I</b> am rich enough to buy every single hound here a new squeaker twice!" [Angry]
"I certainly showed everyone my potential!" [Disgust]
 
Acacia: "(Woah, I thought rich people struggling was a thing that happened in movies.)"
"(I guess capitalism works differently in hell.)"
"It must've been hard for you to endure such hardship...I'm so sorry."
"This card seems to represent your struggle with having nothing."
"From poverty, you had to work hard and climb your way to the top, leading us to the present, am I right?"

Zuckerbork: "Yes, that is correct." [Neutral]
"I would rather not dwell on the past too much, so let's move on, shall we?"

Acacia: "Of course."
