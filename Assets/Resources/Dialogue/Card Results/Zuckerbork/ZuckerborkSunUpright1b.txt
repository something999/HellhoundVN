Zuckerbork: "Ms. Acacia, have you ever heard the saying that money can't buy happiness?" [Disgust]
Acacia: "Yeah, I've heard that phrase, but I don't understand what you mean by that."
Zuckerbork: "Don't assume that you have all of the facts."
"Success isn't always so glamorous."
"And if you think that success is everything, I suggest you re-evaluate your perspective."
[Neutral]
Acacia: "(Shit, I messed up!)"
"(I need to think more carefully about the meaning of these cards.)"
