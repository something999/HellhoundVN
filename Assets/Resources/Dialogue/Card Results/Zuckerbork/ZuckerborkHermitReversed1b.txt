Zuckerbork: "...Go on." [Neutral]

Acacia: "Well, the Hermit, reversed, suggests feeling lost and alone."
"From what I can infer, you've been alone the majority of your life."
"To be thrown out because you were seen as nothing must've really taken a toll on your self-worth."
"Tell me, Mr. Zuckerbork, why did you create Snoutbook?"

Zuckerbork: "To prove them all wrong of course!" [Neutral]
"Everyone I've ever met told me my life wouldn't amount to anything." [Neutral]
"They said I'd be lucky if I ended up as the demons' cattle!"
"So I learned to code and become a business dog!" [Happy]
"Now I'm the richest hound in hell!" [Laughing]
[Happy]
Acacia: "That's great, and I'm happy for you."
"But did you ever stop to consider that maybe you're not fulfilled with your success?"

Zuckerbork: "How so?" [Confused]

Acacia: "Well, you made an app to prove everyone wrong, and that's great."
"But what about your personal desires?"
"Are you working for yourself or just to make a point?"
"I know the distinction doesn't look like it matters, but it's important to do what you want to do."
"That's what this card is telling you: to sit down and adjust career to what you want!"

Zuckerbork: "I suppose you have a point." [Neutral]
"I've been thinking lately that maybe running a business and coding isn't my true calling." [Sadness]
"Sometimes I wondered where I would be if Snoutbook had been a failure..."
"Your cartomancy have proven themselves at least somewhat useful." [Neutral]
"So, if I may ask -- what should I do to remedy this issue?" [Confused]

Acacia: "(Only one card left!)"
"(Now it's time to tie everything together with the future.)"
"(I got this!)"
